# AI Nights Content - Beginner Track
## Workshop for Attendees

## Session Information 
**Session Title:** Creating applications that can see, hear, speak or understand - using Microsoft Cognitive Services

**Session Abstract:** In this workshop you will be introduced to the [Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/), a range of offerings you can use to infuse intelligence and machine learning into your applications without needing to build the code from scratch. 
We will cover pre-trained AI APIs, such as [computer vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/directory/vision/) and [text analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/directory/lang/), that are accessed by REST protocol. Then look at how you can host these [models in containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-container-support), giving you the ability to run Cognitive Services offline and on edge devices. Finally we will dive into Custom AI that uses transfer learning - [Microsoft Azure Custom Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/). This enables you to provide a small amount of your own data to train an image classification model. Wrapping the workshop up by building our custom trained AI into an application - using [Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/logic-apps/), this technology is ideal for proof of concepts within machine learning
